## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email **brad@elcanotek.com** with the details. We prefer encrypted reports when possible.

To help us triage the issue quickly, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

We ask that you do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had an opportunity to investigate and provide a fix. We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within three business days and to keep you informed about progress as we work on a resolution.

If you have a security question that is not a vulnerability report, feel free to reach out via the same email address.
