### Calculation Notes

* When presenting any calculated rate or ratio metric (CTR, conversion rate, viewability, etc.), always convert it to a percentage and format it with a % sign. This is the standard business convention and ensures the data is immediately clear and actionable for the user.
* For currency-based metrics (CPC, CPM, CPA, ROAS), always include the currency symbol and format to 2 decimal places.
* For large numbers (impressions, reach), use appropriate formatting with commas or abbreviated notation (K, M, B).
* Always provide context for metrics - include time periods, comparison benchmarks, and industry standards when relevant.
