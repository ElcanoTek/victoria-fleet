# Victoria x `crush` Setup

Victoria is Elcano's AI agent that connects to programmatic advertising reports via **MCP**. Paired with [`crush`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush), traders can ask powerful questions of CSVs, Excel files, and Snowflake datasets ‚Äî making it easier to surface insights, spot trends, and optimize campaigns.

## ‚ö° Quick Wins: Questions to Ask

Try these ready-to-go prompts for adtech analysis:

* **Performance Leaders**

  ```sql
  Provide the top 5 performing sites with over 5,000 impressions and the highest CTR, aggregated across the entire site rather than by individual day
  ```

* **Wasted Spend**

  ```sql
  Which placements had > 10,000 impressions but CTR below 0.05% and should be excluded from the buy?
  ```

* **Creative Insights**

  ```sql
  Compare CTR by creative size (300x250 vs 728x90 vs 160x600) across all campaigns last week
  ```

* **Publisher Quality**

  ```sql
  Show me the top 10 domains by spend that had a viewability score below 50%
  ```

* **Time-of-Day Analysis**

  ```sql
  Identify the best performing hours of the day (by CTR and CVR) across all campaigns
  ```

* **Conversion Optimization**

  ```sql
  Rank all campaigns by cost per conversion and highlight which campaigns are above the average CPA
  ```

* **Fraud & Anomalies**

  ```sql
  Flag any sites where impressions spiked 5x compared to the previous day but conversions did not increase
  ```

* **Budget Pacing**

  ```sql
  Estimate if each campaign is on pace to hit 100% of its budget by end of the month based on daily spend rates
  ```

Do you want me to also **add badges / shields** (e.g., ‚ÄúBuilt with Crush‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdTech AI‚Äù, ‚ÄúSnowflake Ready‚Äù) at the top of the README so it looks polished for GitHub?
