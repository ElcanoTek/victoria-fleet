Victoria is Elcano's AI agent for navigating programmatic advertising datasets. Traders can ask natural-language questions of CSVs, Excel workbooks, and SQL-queryable sources to surface insights, spot trends, and optimize campaigns without leaving the terminal.

## üîê Security & Licensing at a Glance

- **Container-first distribution.** Victoria ships as a Podman image that packages Python, the `crush` CLI, and all dependencies. Running in a container isolates the agent from the host OS while still allowing controlled file sharing via `~/Victoria`.
- **Secrets stay in your workspace.** Credentials are written to `~/Victoria/.env`, mounted into the container at runtime. The entry point can regenerate or update this file without embedding secrets in the image.
- **Transparent builds.** GitHub Actions automatically builds and publishes the container to `ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal`, ensuring every release is reproducible and verified in CI.
- **Open, source-available code.** The repository is available for review and contribution under the [Elastic License 2.0](LICENSE), so teams can audit changes and collaborate while retaining commercial protections.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Analysts & Traders

New to containers? No problem. This section walks you through the minimum steps needed to launch Victoria and start asking questions about your data.

### 1. Check your prerequisites

1. **Install Podman** from [podman.io](https://podman.io) or your operating system's package manager.
2. **Verify Podman works** by running `podman --version`. If you see a version number, you're ready to go.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you install the podman-cli make sure the Podman machine is running before continuing. After installation, run the following from a Terminal:
> ```powershell
> podman machine init   # first run only
> podman machine start
> ```
> Podman Desktop performs these steps automatically the first time it launches.

### 2. (Optional) Use the helper script

Once Podman is installed, you can let Victoria wire up the remaining pieces for you. The helper scripts below validate that Podman is ready, make sure your `~/Victoria` workspace exists, detect the Podman host architecture (using `podman info` when available with a local fallback), pull the matching container image tag, and add a reusable `victoria` command to your shell profile.

* **macOS / Linux**
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElcanoTek/victoria-terminal/main/install_victoria.sh | bash
  ```
* **Windows (PowerShell)**
  ```powershell
  irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElcanoTek/victoria-terminal/main/install_victoria.ps1 | iex
  ```

After the helper finishes, open a new terminal session (or reload your profile with `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`, or `. $PROFILE`) and start Victoria with a single command:

```bash
victoria
```

The helper keeps the `victoria` command up to date for you, so there's no need to copy the longer `podman run` incantation each time.

Re-run the script any time you want to refresh the alias. It will not reinstall Podman for you, but it will remind you to start `podman machine` on macOS and Windows if needed.

### 3. Create the shared workspace folder

Victoria stores configuration and credentials in a folder that is mounted into the container. Create it once and reuse it for every upgrade:

* **macOS / Linux**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/Victoria
  ```
* **Windows (PowerShell)**
  ```powershell
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$HOME/Victoria" -Force
  ```
* **Windows (Command Prompt)**
  ```cmd
  mkdir %USERPROFILE%\Victoria
  ```

### 4. Confirm your CPU architecture

Victoria publishes multi-architecture tags. If you're unsure which CPU architecture your Podman host is using, check it with:

```bash
podman info --format '{{.Host.Arch}}'
```

Use the table below to pull (or update) the matching image and run it. Re-running the `podman pull` command keeps you on the latest release.

| Platform | CPU architecture | Pull / update | Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS or Linux (Intel/AMD) | `x86_64` | `podman pull ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest` | `podman run --rm -it -v ~/Victoria:/root/Victoria ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest` |
| macOS or Linux (Arm64) | `arm64` | `podman pull ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest-arm64` | `podman run --rm -it -v ~/Victoria:/root/Victoria ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest-arm64` |
| Windows PowerShell (Intel/AMD) | `x86_64` | `podman pull ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest` | `podman run --rm -it -v "$env:USERPROFILE/Victoria:/root/Victoria" ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest` |
| Windows PowerShell (Arm64) | `arm64` | `podman pull ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest-arm64` | `podman run --rm -it -v "$env:USERPROFILE/Victoria:/root/Victoria" ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest-arm64` |

> [!NOTE]
> The run commands are shown on a single line to work in PowerShell and other shells without additional escaping. On macOS and Linux you can add `\` line continuations if you prefer.

On macOS and Linux you can split the run command across multiple lines for readability (the example below shows the `x86_64` tag; swap in the tag from the table above if you are on Arm64):

```bash
podman run --rm -it \
  -v ~/Victoria:/root/Victoria \
  ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest
```

To pass command-line options directly to the entry point script (`victoria_terminal.py`), append them after a `--` separator:

```bash
podman run --rm -it \
  -v ~/Victoria:/root/Victoria \
  ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest -- --course 2
```

Windows users should keep the commands on a single line and use `$env:USERPROFILE/Victoria` in place of `~/Victoria`.

### 5. Configure on first run

The container entry point (`victoria_terminal.py`) guides the initial setup:

- If it detects configuration files in `~/Victoria`, it reuses them automatically.
- Otherwise it prompts for essentials‚ÄîOpenRouter API keys‚Äîand saves them to `~/Victoria/.env`.

Re-run the configuration wizard at any time without launching the UI:

```bash
podman run --rm -it \
  -v ~/Victoria:/root/Victoria \
  ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal:latest -- --reconfigure --skip-launch
```

You can also point the entry point at an alternate shared location with `--shared-home /path/to/shared/Victoria`.

> [!TIP]
> Swap in the image tag that matches your architecture (from the table above) and adjust the host path syntax for your platform. Windows PowerShell users should run the command on a single line with `$env:USERPROFILE/Victoria`.

### 6. Choose an AI model in Crush

When testing **Victoria** in the terminal, we recommend the following models. They have been vetted for compatibility, reliability, and cost.

| **Model Name**           | **How It Appears in Crush (under ‚úÖ Configured)** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ChatGPT 5               | `OpenAI: GPT-5`                                   |
| ChatGPT 5 Mini          | `OpenAI: GPT-5 Mini`                              |
| xAI Grok Code Fast 1    | `xAI: Grok Code Fast 1`                           |
| Google Gemini 2.5 Pro   | `Google: Gemini 2.5 Pro`                          |
| Google Gemini 2.5 Flash | `Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash`                        |

**Selecting a model:**

1. Launch Victoria in your terminal.
2. Press **`Ctrl+P`** to open the command menu.
3. Choose **‚ÄúSelect Model.‚Äù**
4. Use the search bar to find a recommended model (for example, type `GPT-5` or `Gemini 2.5`).
5. Under the **‚úÖ Configured** heading, pick one of the models from the table above.

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> - These five models are the only ones approved for Victoria at this time.
> - Selecting a model outside this list is unsupported and may produce unreliable results.
> - Victoria remembers the last model you selected and loads it automatically on the next launch.
> - To compare results across models, switch models and **restart Victoria** so each model begins with a fresh context.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer & Contributor Guide

Follow this path if you plan to modify Victoria or run the automated tests.

### Clone the repository and set up a virtual environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElcanoTek/victoria-terminal.git
# Or use SSH
git clone git@github.com:ElcanoTek/victoria-terminal.git
cd victoria-terminal

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run tests and linters on the host

With the virtual environment activated, run the automated checks via
[Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/):

```bash
nox -s lint
nox -s tests
```

Both sessions create (and reuse) virtual environments so the commands can also
be executed on a clean workstation without manually activating `.venv`. If you
prefer to iterate inside the existing environment, you can still execute
individual tools directly, for example `pytest` or `flake8`.

### Build and test the container locally

Use Podman to build the development image and run commands inside it:

```bash
podman build -t victoria-terminal .

#optionally run pytest
podman run --rm -it \
  victoria-terminal pytest

#run the terminal agent
podman run --rm -it \
  -v ~/Victoria:/root/Victoria \
  victoria-terminal
```

Both approaches share the same source tree and configuration files stored in `~/Victoria`.

### Continuous delivery pipeline

Every push to `main` triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that rebuilds the Podman image and publishes it to `ghcr.io/elcanotek/victoria-terminal`. The published image is what production users run, so CI keeps dependencies and CLI tooling up to date.
